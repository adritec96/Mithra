# MITHRA: Multi-distributed Intelligence Towards Higher Resilience Assets

The MITHRA system is conceived as an intelligent security incident detection and response system built as a proactive multi-agent system distributed over the IT infrastructure to be protected.

MITHRA is the second part of a previous TFG called CID and should be an interoperable system, working with the diversity of operative systems and existing IT infrastructures, easy and fast to deploy, distributed and based on artificial intelligence techniques to optimally coordinate incident response and increase the autonomy and resilience of the own system.
